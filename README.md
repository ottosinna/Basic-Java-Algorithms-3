The Complex class models complex numbers using the Rational class for the real and imaginary components, allowing complex numbers to be represented with rational parts. The Complex class includes two constructors: one that initializes only the real part (defaulting the imaginary part to zero) and another that initializes both the real and imaginary parts. The toString method provides a string representation of the complex number, accounting for cases where the imaginary part is null. The Rational class, used by Complex, represents rational numbers and provides multiple constructors for different types of input (integers, strings, and doubles). It includes methods to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) and normalize fractions. The Test class demonstrates string manipulation for different rational number formats, and the Utility class provides the GCD calculation method. Together, these classes illustrate a system for handling and displaying complex numbers with rational components, ensuring proper parsing, normalization, and string representation.
